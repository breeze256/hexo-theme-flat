# Flat for Hexo

> Please be aware that this theme is still WORK IN PROGRESS.

Flat for Hexo theme is a light and simple theme based on
[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/). Its code is easy to read and easy
to be modified.

The main purpose of developing this theme is for me to learn about front-end 
development and try out some new things.

* Use [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) as its layout framework.
* Use [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) to manage its dependences.

## Quick Start

It is recommended to install the theme via node,

```bash
npm install --save hexo-theme-flat
```

Or, you can install the theme manually,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/breeze256/hexo-theme-flat.git ./themes/flat
```

Once you install the theme, change the default theme in your `_config.yml`.

```yaml
# Extensions

```
